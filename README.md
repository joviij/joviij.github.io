# Personal Website

A simple portfolio that I made for myself using Polymer/Web Components. The main purpose of this project was to try to teach myself webcomponents (while also giving my portfolio a much needed update). 

The whole structure of the project is simple with a few components. Most of the components are simple structures with a some state logic + event handling. 

To view the application locally, run the following command:
```
$ polymer serve
```

To build:
```
$ polymer build
```
